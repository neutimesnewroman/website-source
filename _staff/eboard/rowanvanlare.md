Despite having a beard, Rowan brings the sex appeal 
to all Times New Roman meetings and events. Some 
say she's just the Head of Writing, 
but people in the know know that she's 
a whole lot more. When she's not 
writing love poems to her third grade English teacher, 
she enjoys fantasizing about her third grade English teacher.
