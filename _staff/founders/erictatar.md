Besides being the Head Editor, Chief Video Producer,
Site and Issue Designer, and a co-founder who actually 
continued going to meetings, Eric's life amounts to nothing.
His vital contribution to Times New Roman is the only thing 
that his mother is proud of him for. The fact that TNR would
have accomplished nothing without his diligent efforts
is still -- even after several years in which he, if he were
a marginally more likeable person, might have accomplished
something of actual value -- highlighted on the top of 
his resume. It's kind of sad.
