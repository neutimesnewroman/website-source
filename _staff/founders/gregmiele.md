If Times New Roman is a phoenix, Greg is the
magic stuff that woke it from its ashes to blossom
into the magestic flower it is today. When Gus put up
a flyer asking if anyone would be interested in
forming a comedy writing club, Greg was the only one
to respond. Luckily, his excellent networking skills that 
he learned in Intro to Co-op enabled him to drag 8 of
his friends to the first meeting, thus securing TNR's
status as real, school-recognised, phoenix.
