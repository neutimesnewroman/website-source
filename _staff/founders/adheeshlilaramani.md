Adheesh showed up to one of the first meetings of
Times New Roman, helping to satisfy the Northeastern
University Bureaucracy's official minimum number
of people needed to form a recognized student
organization. For this, his name shall forevermore
be hallowed on this webpage. 

He never returned to another meeting.
