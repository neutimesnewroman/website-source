Needlessly proud valedictorian of her Eighth Grade Class. Was 
unable to spell valedictorian at that time. Still unsure 
of how to spell valedictorian and has googled it three 
times while writing this. Now temporarily aware of how 
to spell valedictorian. Also intolerant of lactose. Some 
believe she is lactose intolerant. Rather than cows, 
Delaney milks oats.
