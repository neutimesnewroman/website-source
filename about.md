Thank you for reading Times New Roman, Northeastern 
University’s Premier satire/comedy newspaper, 
gazette, digital thing-a-majig!

Founded sometime in the past, Times New Roman 
was Northeastern’s satirical magazine before disbanding sometime 
in the past, but not so far in 
the past that it was before the time in 
the past when it was founded. It is 
unclear why Times New Roman disbanded, but it 
was surely over some sketchy shit.
_But don’t worry, none of that matters because we're back!_


TNR is here to bring satire, stories, 
and comedy of every variety bi-weekly(ish)
to further enrich Northeastern. You can 
also expect videos whenever our wonderful writers have a 
creative spark of genius.


We know you're probably only here because 
one of our members gave you a really uncomfortable 
look, but we're glad you stopped 
by!If you give TNR a chance, 
we promise you'll find a plethora of 
sub-par jokes and a few adequate ones.


By reading Times New Roman, you’ll 
laugh, you’ll cry (from laughter), 
you’ll get angry (with laughter),
you’ll die (from laughter!), 
and a bunch of other stuff. Read more 
of our issues in the archive and check out 
our videos if you like what you see!


Even if you don't, give us 
a chance to redeem ourselves by sending any feedback 
you have to

Times New Roman meets every Tuesday at 7 PM in Ryder Hall 296.
